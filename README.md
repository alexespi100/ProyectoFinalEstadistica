# ProyectoFinalEstadistica
Proyecto Final de Mecánica Estadística relacionado con la distribución de Yakovenko
Final project of Statistical Mechanics telated to Yakovenko's distribution

The project aims to run a simulation of simple economic population executing a certain number of transactions
made by random agents from this set. Starting at the same wealth, while time advances (iterations of the program)
A final distribution can be appreciated, which suggests the model converges to a certain state. The same can be
inferred of particle systems analyzed in a confined space (taking into account the movement and collisions in this
space).
